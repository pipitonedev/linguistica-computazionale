NOME--->  Mr. Samsa

FRASE CORTA: ", asked  Mr. Samsa.

FRASE LUNGA: As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and
would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the
more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher's
boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his
way up and came nearer than they were,  Mr. Samsa and the women came
away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.

NOME--->  Project Gutenberg

FRASE CORTA: Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.

FRASE LUNGA: If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.

NOME--->  Gregor

FRASE CORTA: Did you hear the way
Gregor spoke just now?"

FRASE LUNGA: She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of
smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted
to help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuck
fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he,
too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in
the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she
was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned
round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut
Gregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;
now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles
she could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door
shut with her foot.

NOME--->  God

FRASE CORTA: "Oh, God!"

FRASE LUNGA: She did not see him straight
away, but when she did notice him under the couch - he had to be
somewhere, for God's sake, he couldn't have flown away - she was so
shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut
again from outside.

NOME--->  Grete

FRASE CORTA: ", said Grete and
looked around.

FRASE LUNGA: She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of
smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted
to help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuck
fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he,
too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in
the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she
was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned
round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut
Gregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;
now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles
she could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door
shut with her foot.

NOME--->  Samsa

FRASE CORTA: Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide
and briefly nodded to him several times.

FRASE LUNGA: A collection of textile samples
lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and
above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an
illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.

NOME--->  Mr.

FRASE CORTA: Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide
and briefly nodded to him several times.

FRASE LUNGA: With all the
worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but,
while they were talking,  Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost
simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was
blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.

NOME--->  Franz Kafka

- FRASE PIU' CORTA E PIU' LUNGA CHE CONTENGONO I 10 NOMI PROPRI PIU' FREQUENTI PER IL TESTO 2 ( postscript.txt ) -

NOME--->  Brown

FRASE CORTA: He said old Brown shouldn't get any free
advertising in that office.

FRASE LUNGA: You know what printers will do if you give them a chance, so here
is the way the poem came out in the paper:

    To Miss Judkins
    (Visiting Mrs. T. Montcalm Brown.)

NOME--->  Mr. Porter

FRASE CORTA: This was sent me by Mr. Ed McLean, Secretary of the
    Railroad Commission, a mutual friend of Mr. Porter and
    myself.

FRASE LUNGA: I enjoyed my acquaintance and association with Mr.
    Porter while a youth in the business office of the Houston
    _Post_ and not only the stories that he would write,
    but those he would tell me, made a deep impression on my
    mind.

NOME--->  Robert

FRASE CORTA: "Robert!"

FRASE LUNGA: Robert looked in the mirror as straight as he could, counted his
reflections, and then yelled loud enough to be heard a block away:

"Gosh dang it, gi' us six glasses beer and put 'em on ice, Susie, old
girl, or I'll clean out your joint, 'n bus' up business.

NOME--->  Jim

FRASE CORTA: Tom, and Henry, and Jim, and Charlie were in
raptures.

FRASE LUNGA: "I think if I could git hold of Jim's hand,
    And kinder explain the words I said,
    He'd know his old dad's heart would ever
    Be just the same--but I guess Jim's dead.

NOME--->  Houston

FRASE CORTA: 502 Carter Building, Houston, Texas.

FRASE LUNGA: I traveled around all over Houston and found nine widows of
Supreme Court judges, twelve relicts of governors and generals, and
twenty-two ruins left by happy departed colonels, professors, and
majors, who put fancy figures on the benefits of their society, and
carried victuals as a side line.

NOME--->  Henry

FRASE CORTA: "Oh, Henry," she simpered.

FRASE LUNGA: Neither the compilation, verification, nor publication of these
newspaper writings of O. Henry would have been possible without the
co-operation of Mr. Roy G. Watson, present proprietor and publisher of
the Houston _Post_, whose consent for their publication has been
generously given; and of Governor William P. Hobby, Colonel R. M.
Johnston, and Mr. A. E. Clarkson, all associated with the _Post_
during O. Henry's employment, and to these, whose attestation of
authenticity of this work is herewith given, the compiler is grateful.

NOME--->  Mr.

FRASE CORTA: Mr. Mantell ought not to allow this.

FRASE LUNGA: Mr. Porter's work was that of publishing a special
    feature column, "Some Postscripts and Pencillings" on the
    editorial page of the _Post_ during 1895-96, and I
    think a reproduction of his daily writings in that column,
    which then were followed by the readers of the Texas
    newspaper readers of the nation.

NOME--->  John

FRASE CORTA: "Oh, John," she said.

FRASE LUNGA: Oh, what shall I--"

John turned without a word and rushed back down the street, but the
shady-looking man was not to be found.

NOME--->  George

FRASE CORTA: asked George, in an agony of suspense.

FRASE LUNGA: "You were thinking
of a redheaded girl named Maud with a gold plug in her front tooth and
a light pink waist and a black silk skirt on Rusk Avenue, standing
under a cedar bush chewing gum at twenty minutes to eight with your
arm around her waist and calling her 'sweetness,' while she fooled
with your watch chain and said: 'Oh, George, give me a chance to
breathe,' and her mother was calling her to supper.
